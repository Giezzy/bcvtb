Checklist of BCVTB release
**************************
Update the copyright notices to ....-20xx. in 
bcvtb/legal.html
doc/manual/latex-title/titlepage.tex

Update release notes in
doc/manual/ch-rele.xml

Run
source bin/setDevelopmentEnvironment.sh 

Check lib/defines.h
The section should be
/** \val Debug flag, uncomment to enable debug messages 
#ifndef NDEBUG 
#define NDEBUG 
#endif
*/

Make sure user.properties has no assignments.


Update version number in 
 - build-common.xml    ( <property name="VERSION"  value="0.3.0-pre-release"/> )
 - install/install.xml ( <appversion>0.3.0-pre-release</appversion> )


Update Ptolemy files (to write version number into Ptolemy)
Note: expat needs to be installed and libexpat.so or libexpat.so.1 should 
be found when running configure in PTII otherwise lib/ptII/lbnl/lbnl.jar won't be copied.
This will cause all the BCVTB examples to fail.
If we use ant to compile the Ptolemy files then we need to call ant jars afterwards to jar the files.
Before updating tthe Ptolemy files,
cd ~/ptII-dev (ptII-dev is our local development version of Ptolemy II)
export PTII=`pwd`
rm -f config.*
./configure
run ant 
run ant jars

export BCVTB_PTIISrc=$PTII (in the BCVTB after setDevelopment.sh is called)

(To add jars file to the list of BCVTB jars file go in your development version of PTII 
and change to mk/jnlp.mk and edit the BCVTB_JNLP_JARS list.)
ant updatePtolemyFiles

 - Commit changes
    svn commit -m "Updated version number"

Reset BCVTB_PTIISrc and PTII (This can be done by closing the terminal, reopening a new one,
and recalling source bin/setDevelopment.sh to set environment variables.)

Update version number of EnergyPlus to be displayed on start page in
 - lib/ptII

Run 
  cleanfilesystem

From Linux, run
  ant clean cleandoc doc

To build the release, run from Windows (or Linux or Mac)
  ant clean all
  (This will compile the Windows/Linux/Mac binaries)

From Linux, run one of the commands:
  ant dist-bcvtb       [to make distribution for bcvtb only]
  
Rename file bcvtb-install-x.y.z.jar to 
   bcvtb-install-win32-x.y.z.jar
   bcvtb-install-linux32-x.y.z.jar
   bcvtb-install-mac64-x.y.z.jar

Make new directory
ssh mwetter@simulationresearch
cd /usr/local/www/simulationresearch/bcvtb/releases
mkdir x.y.z
exit

run 
cd install
scp bcvtb-install-x.y.z.jar mwetter@simulationresearch.lbl.gov:/usr/local/www/simulationresearch/bcvtb/releases/x.y.z/

To copy the documentation, run
cd doc
ant dist

Next, log in to simulationresearch, and change the symbolic link:
cd /usr/local/www/simulationresearch/bcvtb/releases
ln -s x.y.z latest

----
To make tag, 

Run

git tag + version number (git tag -a v1.6.0 -m"Version 1.6.0")
to create a tag for the current release version and
git push origin v1.6.0 to push to the origin

Lastly
In github create a new release which will point to the tag.
Add this as an additional resource when creating the new release.
