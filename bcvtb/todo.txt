double-clicking on bcvtb.lnk does not work if bcvtb is installed in
C:\Program Files\bcvbt-0.3.0-pre-release

Change
@set BCVTB_DYMOLA_BIN=C:\Program Files\Dymola 7.2\bin\Dymola.exe
so that it pickes "Program Files" in correct language

-- Compilation --
On mac, compilation fails if bcvtb is for example in directory /Users/mwetter/test/bcvtb 030  [note the space]


-- Ptolemy --

Implement client response as soon as socket can be established because now it can take a long time until EnergyPlus warmed up and responds.

Look into using xpath instead of libxml2, depending on native support on Mac, Linux and Windows.

See if _writeToServer can be called prior to fire; as the CPU time is primarily consumed in clients between _writeToServer and _readFromServer

Under Ubuntu 7.04, the following command freezes the shell after E+ completed. Maybe the buffer is not flushed?
cd examples/ePlusNatVen
ptexecute system.xml

Copy variables.xml to working directory.

Can variables.xml be used to check for correct number of input and output of Actor?

Make editor for variables.xml

-- E+ --

Add E+ compact schedule.

Integrate with
  - user functions
  - EMS

Address the issue that a user may try to run a design day simulation in E+. 
Maybe include special actors, i.e., for E+, for Simulink etc., to facilitate the use of the BCVTB and the setup of the simulation, and/or catch situation in E+ source.

-- Matlab --
Simulink interface: catch situation where we read too many double values.
