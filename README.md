# The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB)

This is the development site for the BCVTB program.

Stable releases including all previous releases are available from the main project site
at http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/bcvtb.

## BCVTB description

The BCVTB is a software environment that allows users to couple different simulation programs for co-simulation, and to couple simulation programs with actual hardware. For example, the BCVTB allows to simulate a building in EnergyPlus and the HVAC and control system in Modelica, while exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is based on the Ptolemy II software environment. The BCVTB allows expert users of simulation to expand the capabilities of individual programs by linking them to other programs. Due to the different programs that may be involved in distributed simulation, familiarity with configuring programs is essential.
