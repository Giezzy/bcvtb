How to get documentation for BACnetReader and BACnetWriter.
Maybe include these actors in the Ptolemy trunk?

Use variables.xml to check for correct number of input and output of E+ actor. Requires special actor for E+.

Make editor for variables.xml

Make actor to extract elements of data that are output of BACnetReader.

Make actor that reads from xml, and returns last known value if read fails.

Make actors for LonWorks, Dali, etc.
